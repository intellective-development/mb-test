<h3>New Product Type</h3>

<p>
  Product Types are in a tree structure.  For example, If you create a shirt product-type, you should probably start by creating "clothes".  Then create a "shirt" product type who's parent is clothes. Depending on the store you could have a tee-shirt and tank-top product-type that has a parent of shirt.
